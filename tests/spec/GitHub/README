Description:
Tests for the GitHub Flavored Markdown extensions to the CommonMark spec.

Local Modifications:
This directory contains the gfm_spec_v0_29_0_gfm_13.json file, which is derived from test/spec.txt
by running `python test/spec_tests.py -d -s test/spec.txt`. The generated JSON was further modifed to
produce test cases for this project.
The patch in spec_tests.py.patch was applied to test/spec_tests.py before generating gfm_spec_v0_29_0_gfm_13.json.
